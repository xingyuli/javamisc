javamisc
========

This project gives miscellneous Java demonstrations. It is aimed at playing a
role as a reminder for me. And if you occasionaly have chances to got a solution
for your problem, it is really a worth for the whole work I've done here!

All the demos come from other Java developers' blogs, websites and some
interesting stuff when I surf the internet.

> **:p**
> The demos provided here are quite limited as I can only spent very limited time
> working on this small project. If you need any help from me, just mail me via:
> xingyu_liu@qq.com or xingyulliiuu@gmail.com
