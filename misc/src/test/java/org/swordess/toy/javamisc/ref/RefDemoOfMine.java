 * What are "roots"?
 * <p>
 * 
 * In a simple Java application, they're method parameters and local variables
 * stored on the stack, the operands of the currently executing expression(also
 * stored on the stack), and static class member variables.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>
 * NOTE:
 * Whether or not a strongly reference depends on whether can be referenced by a
 * certain reference chain start from a root reference, it has no relationship
 * with the reference type! 
 * </b>
 * <p>
 * 
 * It's important to understand root references, because they define what a
 * "strong" reference is: if you can follow a chain of references from a root to
 * a particular object, then that object is "strongly" referenced.
